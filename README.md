👋 Hello, world!  My name is Keith.
-  🧠 I've been educating myself through collegiate and self-driven studies for over 7 years now.  I love it and look forward to continuing my studies every day!
-  🎨 To me, programming is one of the most challenging yet expressive forms of art.  I aspire to make masterpieces one day.
-  🌱 I am currently learning more about Machine Learning on the side, but am focused on strengthening my overall fundamentals.
-  🏠 When I am not honing my programming skills and figuring out ways to apply them, you can find me spending time with family, enjoying great music, making digital art, gaming, and working out.
-  🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on everything!  I am here to learn and grow both personally and as a software engineer.
