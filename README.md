- 👋 Hi, I’m @PandaBump
- 👀 I’m interested in coding as both a hobby and career.  I hope to create my own game some day soon that many people will have fun with.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, C++, C#, Javascript, with other various languages on the side.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything!  I am here to learn and grow both personally and as a software developer.  Feel free to reach out if you need another mind to form solutions.
- 📫 How to reach me is through my email, or, on GitHub!  My email is stokesk6128@gmail.com
