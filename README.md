- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, world!  My name is Keith.
-  After 7+ years of self-learning and gaining structured proficiency in several coding languages such as Python and JavaScript, I now feel prepared for a professional career with coding.
-  Coding has been a passion of mine for longer than I've studied it.  It has given me my toughest mental challenges while rewarding my desire to create - two things I cherish the most when it comes to enjoying what I do.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on everything!  I am here to learn and grow both personally and as a software developer.  Feel free to reach out if you need another mind to problem-solve.
-  I hope to be able to provide efficient and highly revered solutions and to create my own game some day soon as a passion project.
-  The best way to contact me is through my email (stokesk.swe@gmail.com), Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-stokes-swe/), or through my website (https://pandabump.github.io/)!
